[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindwiringPi.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "wiringPi",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "wiringPi" with any
  of the following names:

    wiringPiConfig.cmake
    wiringpi-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "wiringPi" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "wiringPi_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "wiringPi" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
